I am <span style="color:#1f4e79; font-weight:600;">Ruoyan Xu</span>, a Ph.D. candidate at the  
<span style="color:#1f4e79;">Institute of Medical Technology, Peking University Health Science Center</span>,  
affiliated with the <span style="color:#1f4e79;">Medical Imaging Laboratory (MILAB)</span> directed by  
Professor <span style="color:#1f4e79;">Zhaoheng Xie</span>.

My research is broadly situated at the intersection of  
<span style="color:#7a1f2b; font-weight:500;">biomedical engineering</span>,  
<span style="color:#7a1f2b; font-weight:500;">medical imaging</span>, and  
<span style="color:#7a1f2b; font-weight:500;">artificial intelligence</span>,  
with a particular emphasis on  
<span style="color:#7a1f2b;">nuclear medicine and multimodal image analysis</span>.

My current work focuses on two main research directions:

**(1) Multimodal neuroimaging for Alzheimer’s disease**  
I investigate systemic and brain-specific metabolic alterations in Alzheimer’s disease using  
<span style="color:#444444;">total-body PET/CT</span>, integrating whole-body FDG and amyloid PET imaging  
with <span style="color:#444444;">network-based</span> and  
<span style="color:#444444;">AI-driven analytical frameworks</span>.  
This work aims to uncover disease-related metabolic network disruptions beyond the central nervous system.

**(2) AI-driven multimodal imaging for Graves’ ophthalmopathy**  
I am also involved in developing a precision assessment and staging framework for Graves’ ophthalmopathy  
based on <span style="color:#444444;">[¹⁸F]AlF-NOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT</span> and  
<span style="color:#444444;">deep learning–based multimodal image fusion</span>,  
with the goal of improving quantitative evaluation and clinical stratification.

Overall, my research interest lies in developing  
<span style="color:#7a1f2b; font-weight:500;">AI-driven methods for multimodal medical imaging</span>,  
aiming to translate advanced imaging technologies into  
<span style="color:#7a1f2b;">clinically interpretable</span> and  
<span style="color:#7a1f2b;">biologically meaningful</span> tools for precision medicine.
