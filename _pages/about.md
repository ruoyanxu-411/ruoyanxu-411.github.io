I am **Ruoyan Xu**, a Ph.D. candidate at the **Institute of Medical Technology,
Peking University Health Science Center**, affiliated with the **Medical Imaging
Laboratory (MILAB)** led by Professor **Zhaoheng Xie**.

My research is broadly situated at the intersection of **biomedical engineering,
medical imaging, and artificial intelligence**, with a particular emphasis on
**nuclear medicine and multimodal image analysis**.

My current work focuses on two main research directions:

**(1) Multimodal neuroimaging for Alzheimer’s disease**  
I investigate systemic and brain-specific metabolic alterations in Alzheimer’s
disease using **total-body PET/CT**, integrating whole-body FDG and amyloid PET
imaging with network-based and AI-driven analytical frameworks. This line of work
aims to uncover disease-related metabolic network disruptions beyond the central
nervous system and to support early diagnosis, disease progression monitoring,
and treatment evaluation.

**(2) AI-driven multimodal imaging for Graves’ ophthalmopathy**  
I am also involved in developing a **precision assessment and staging framework
for Graves’ ophthalmopathy** based on **[¹⁸F]AlF-NOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT** and deep
learning–based multimodal image fusion. By integrating functional PET information
with anatomical imaging and data-driven models, this research seeks to improve
quantitative evaluation and clinical stratification of orbital disease.

Overall, my research interest lies in developing **artificial intelligence–driven
methods for multimodal medical imaging**, with the goal of translating advanced
imaging technologies into **clinically interpretable and biologically meaningful
tools** for precision medicine.
